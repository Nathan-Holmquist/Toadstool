Toadstool!!

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Concept

A 3D, squishy-looking game where the main character collects mushrooms and fights enemies in the harsh wilderness. Focus on story and game loop. Metroidvania style game.

## 1.2 Purpose

A small game for Emulen to relax and have fun with as it is not too challenging. It will contain beautiful art, atmospheric levels, and have an explorative nature. The game will have a large focus on atmosphere and music making the experience of playing, the most enjoyable part. A compelling story that will elicit emotional effects on the player.

## 1.3 Target Audience

Emulen :). Single player game, intended for a more laid back audience that might not be too good at video games. Those who are looking for a story intensive game with a fun and simple game loop. Women, typically teenage to 30s. The cutesy and whimsical aesthetic will lend itself well to the demographic. There will be things included like cute animals to promote the content.

## 1.4 Platform and Specs

Ideally it should be able to run on crappy laptops. It should just need a basic graphics processor at the lowest setting. Something like a GTX 1660 (3GB) should be able to run the game smoothly on maximum graphics.

## 1.5 Competition

### 1.5.a (Gris)

A game available for Xbox, Switch, Playstation, and PC. A platformer puzzle adventure with stunning visuals and music. Follows a young woman dealing with loss exploring an unknown world to the player. Many aspects of the environment lend the user to make assumptions about the world. The watercolor art style and atmospheric soundtrack create an immersive experience as the player navigates the protagonist's journey through grief.
Toadstool will follow a similar path with the world building in Gris where the setting and understanding is vague to the player to allow for interpretation and wonder. However, the gameplay will not be as linear as that of Gris, and instead follow a guided linear path. Toadstool will also not be a platformer, and include some basic combat.

### 1.5.a (Hollow Knight)

Available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch. Set in a beautifully hand-drawn, mysterious underground world, Hollow Knight follows a small, silent knight on a journey through ancient, decaying kingdoms. Challenging combat, intricate exploration, and deep lore.
Toadstools combat will appeal much better to that of the average gamer, with combat difficulty settings, providing the option for more challenging gameplay. Toadstool will also have much less of a focus on combat and much more on exploration.

# 2 Gameplay

## 2.1 Minute by Minute Loop

Players will explore the forest with a small book of mushrooms, trying to identify and pick different ones to bring home. There is a day night cycle and the player must return home before the darkness encroaches on the forest. When at home, the player can make potions using the specific mushrooms they picked. To aid in the player remembering mushroom locations, there will be a map system as they progress through different areas. The map will appear to be an “open world”, however, the game will cleverly disguise a path in progression (Metroidvania). The player will interact with NPCs giving them quests to complete as they explore. These NPCs will guide the player in the progression of the story, providing them with bonuses either in items or information as a reward for completing quests. Sometimes enemies will be encountered in the “wild” and they will need to be fought off. The game will progress through boss fights where each boss will guard a special mushroom the charter wishes to collect. These mushrooms will be alluded to via encounters (rough example: “I heard the snake hoards a mushroom for healing!” After a boss fight with the snake, because they are protective of the mushroom, you learn that the snake would give the mushroom to your grandma for her to create a potion to heal the snake's poor eyesight, but they cannot find grandma. The snake explains a potion ingredient to the player while also giving them a small quest to make the potion and bring it back, then they will be friends and the player will have full access to the ingredient and the potions they can make with it).

## 2.2 Session by Session Loop

Players will explore the world as they continue to progress through the story, the further they get in the world, the more difficult the terrain and enemies will become. They will encounter bosses that guard special mushrooms. To balance the ever enhancing world, the player will have the option to gather upgrades (items or buffs), whether through quests or through making potions for themselves.

## 2.3 Full Game Loop

After some days going back and forth into the forest, the player will eventually reach a final boss, guarding a specific mushroom. Once the boss is defeated the player can then complete the story. The player will be able to collect the mushrooms guarded by each boss, and combine them together to cure their grandma. There is only 1 storypath, but a play through should ideally take 6-8 hours. Lots of skippable side quests that aid to enhance the users gear, making the game scale with the enemies.

## 2.4 Difficulty Scaling

There will be four difficulties that the player will have access to when starting their playthrough (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare) (Nightmare mode will be elden ring level challenging). When at home at the end of the day, the player will be able to change the difficulty level. The difficulty will scale the opponents aggressiveness, health and damage.

# 3 Narrative

## 3.1 Worldbuilding and Setting

There is not much known about this mysterious world, besides the fact that all NPCs are small critters. There are towering trees within the forest that the main character explores through. Magic exists, animals are not exactly accurate to scale, and there are weird, fantastical critters that populate the forest.

## 3.2 History

The main froggy’s grandma was an alchemist for the forest and provided potions for all of the citizens of it.

## 3.3 Plot

The main froggy’s grandma is sick and she needs medicines to help her recover. Each day you must go out to forage mushrooms to make potions for her. You only have grandma’s book of mushrooms, when leaving for the first day you dropped the ingredients list and map of the forest in the mud and unfortunately they are not usable. You must combine together ingredients to create potions to hopefully cure grandma. 

## 3.4 Metanarrative

You are trying to find the specific mushrooms needed for the all curing potion for grandma. Grandma is bedridden and unable to tell you what you need. Each boss fight will have a small patch of special mushrooms you can only gather after you beat the boss. You will need to beat every boss + some exploration side quests, to gather all the mushrooms needed to fully cure grandma. Some health potions will wake her for a bit so that she can tell you an ingredient or something (Hints).
