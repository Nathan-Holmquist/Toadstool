# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Concept

A 3D squishy looking game where the main character collects mushrooms and fights enemies in the harsh wilderness. Focus on story and game loop.

## 1.2 Purpose

A small game for Emulen to relax and have fun with as it is not too challenging. It will contain beautiful art, atmospheric levels, and have an explorative nature. The game will have a large focus on atmosphere and music making the experience of playing, the most enjoyable part. A compelling story that will elicit emotional effects on the player.

## 1.3 Target Audience

Emulen :). Single player game, intended for a more laid back audience that might not be too good at video games. Those who are looking for a story intensive game. Women, typically teenage to 30s. The cutesy and whimsical aesthetic will lend itself well to the demographic.

## 1.4 Platform and Specs

Ideally it should be able to run on crappy laptops. It should just need a basic graphics processor at the lowest setting. Something like a GTX 1660 (3GB) should be able to run the game smoothly on maximum graphics.

## 1.5 Competition

### 1.5.a (game name)

# 2 Gameplay

## 2.1 Minute by Minute Loop

Players will explore the forest with a small book of mushrooms, trying to identify and pick different ones to bring home. When brought home the player can make potions using the specific mushrooms they picked. Sometimes enemies will be encountered and they will need to use a small branch to fight them off. There is a day night cycle and the player must return home before the darkness encroaches on the forest. It appears to be an “open world” adventure, however, the game will cleverly disguise a path in progression.

## 2.2 Session by Session Loop

Players will explore the world as they continue to progress through the story, the further they get in the world, the more difficult the terrain and enemies will become. They will encounter bosses that guard special mushrooms. To balance the ever enhancing world, the player will have the option to gather upgrades, whether through quests or through making potions for themselves.

## 2.3 Full Game Loop

The player will eventually reach a final boss, guarding a specific mushroom. Once the boss is defeated the player can then complete the story. There is only 1 storypath, however, ideally a play through should take 6-8 hours. Lots of skippable side quests that aid to enhance the users gear, making the game scale with the enemies.

## 2.4 Difficulty Scaling

There will be three difficulties that the player will have access to when starting their playthrough. There will be certain times where they can change the difficulty as well. The difficulty will scale the opponents aggressiveness, health and damage.

# 3 Narrative

## 3.1 Worldbuilding and Setting

There is not much known about this mysterious world, besides the fact that all NPCs are small critters. There are towering trees within the forest that the main character explores through.

## 3.2 History

The main froggy’s grandma was an alchemist for the forest and provided potions for all of the citizens of it.

## 3.3 Metanarrative

You are trying to find the specific mushrooms needed for the all curing potion for grandma. Grandma is bedridden and unable to tell you what you need. Each boss fight will have a small patch of special mushrooms you can only gather after you beat the boss. You will need to beat every boss + some exploration side quests, to gather all the mushrooms needed to fully cure grandma. Some health potions will have her wake for a bit and tell you an ingredient or something.

## 3.4 Plot

The main froggy’s grandma is sick and she needs medicines to help her recover. Each day you must go out to forage mushrooms to make potions for her. You only have grandma’s book of mushrooms, when leaving for the first day you dropped the ingredients list and map of the forest in the mud and unfortunately they are not usable. You must combine together ingredients to create potions to hopefully cure grandma.
